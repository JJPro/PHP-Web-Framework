# Purpose #
After using Elixir Phoenix and PHP Laravel for quite a time, I decided to make
my own web framework to get a deeper understanding of web frameworks, and will
put to good use in future projects.

This is also a good chance to practice:
- Routing with Regex (i.e. named capturing groups) - map requests to controller/actions.
- PHP 7 new features.
- Composer to integrate with 3rd party libraries.

# Components #
* Router - using Regex to route URL to Controller/action
* Model
* View - The HTML template
* Controller - controller/action decides what view to render and show
